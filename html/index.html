            <h1>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h1>
            <p>
              The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me
              to developer a skillset that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of
              any business.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities
              teaching young minds about how to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a
              whole new world of opportunities.

            <p>
              As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's holding you back
              is yourself.
            </p>
            <p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.</p>
            <p>
              "How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn't fail?" You've already gone through
              the hardest parts being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a
              leader in something you're passionate about.
            </p>
            <p>I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your company.</p>
